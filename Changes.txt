Bugs & Limitations:
- specular lighting seems to be broken, put the light at (0,0,0) and it does not work as expected.
- Phong shading can only handle 1 light at the moment.
- adding objects does not work well - light breaks down and does not resolve nearest object.
- removing diffuse shading from sphere will stop diffuse shading for disc too.
- fix physics engine
- read and implement the following: http://media.tojicode.com/sfjs-vectors/

v0.31 - 02.02.2017
- Refactored into client-side and server-side code.

v0.30
- Simplified code.
- Basic rotation by mouse.

v0.14 - v0.21 - ???
- These versions have been lost.

v0.13d - 13.06.2013
- Aligned the "disc" and "sphere" object properties
- 117ms

v0.13c - 13.06.2013
- Fixed the physics problem, bounces nicely now.
- Changed order of rendering, now rendered properly with current scene. But still a hack. 
- 125ms

v0.13b - 13.06.2013
- add basic physics engine (still needs work).
- change vector class to use typed vectors (for speed).
- 131ms

v0.13a - 09.06.2013
- swapped bmp_lib for native canvas
- changed grid referencing from grid[r][c]={R,G,B} to grid[p]=color
- 153ms

v0.13 - 24.05.2009
- implemented a cheap and nasty anti-aliasing effect
- 613ms

v0.12 - 22.05.2009
- added phong shading including shadow effect.

v0.11 - 22.05.2009
- changed contructors, less iniatialisation at constructor, but now after object is created.
- changed lighting method to ambiant, previously each object has it's own "opacity", now this is controlled by the scene object.

v0.10 - 22.05.2009
- added lighting model to scene
- enabled specular relfections from lights
- fixed disc problem
- fixed reflection bug that reflected two images

v0.09 - 20.05.2009
- further code clean-up
- added relflections

v0.08 - 19.05.2009
- full code tidy up completed - now object orientated.
- added comments.
- Bug: For some reason render time doubled, but no new features were added.
- colour is now a vector.

v0.07 - 18.05.2009
- vectorised much of the code.
- started on a scene object - not complete.

v0.06 - 12.05.2009
- updated to include generic rays, not just from source.
- more generic raytracer setup
- added reflection calculator.
- changed Shade() to recursive function

v0.05 - 11.05.2009
- Added plane. Plane sort of working, not as expected though.

v0.04
- Fixed diagonal bug - there was a bug in my modified version of the bmp library.
