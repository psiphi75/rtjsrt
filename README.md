Realtime Javascript Raytracer - just a small toy project

# Things that can be done

 - Create node.js runable.
 - Reduce object creation to reduce GC.
 - use [ImageBitmap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageBitmap) for the browser.  This will enable direct copying between
   workers and direct drawing to the canvas.
 - For node try GYP (say "jip")
