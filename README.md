# Real-time Javascript Raytracer

It's just a small toy project.  I'd be interested if anybody can make it run faster (I am sure people could).
But there are some conditions:
 - The output must remain the same visually.
 - No ugly hacks (i.e. writing in C/C++ and converting to asm.js).
 - No major changes to the raytracing algorithm.  I'm interested in the JavaScript performance part.
